<h2>Cats in life</h2>
 <h3><p>Many people have different pets and the majority of them are cats. Some people think,
that cats comfort us, give us the feeling of tranquility because these delicate creatures are so cute!
Cats have always been in our lives. In Ancient Egypt, for example, 
cats were sacred animals. Nowadays we keep cats as pets, we need them.
We do it, because cats are good for us. They give us companionship and pleasure. 
For example, a lonely man keeps a cat, because it is a companionship for him. 
You feel happier when you stroke a cat. Cats teach us to be loving and responsible.
Keeping a cat as a pet is good for health! Cats are like doctors! Scientists have proved that if you stroke a cat, 
then your blood pressure will go down and your stress and loneliness will reduce too.
Cats are dependent on people, because they provide them with food, drinking ... 
If you keep a cat, do not forget about it, love it, take care of it ...
I have a beautiful cat, but I would like to. I love it and take care of it, 
because I like these beautiful animals. When I stroke a cat, I become happier.
I also like to listen to happy purring, coming home.</p></h3>

<h2>Cats' history</h2>
<h3><p>It has taken a while for scientists to piece together the riddle of just when and where cats first became domesticated.
One would think that the archaeological record might answer the question easily, 
but wild cats and domesticated cats have remarkably similar skeletons, complicating the matter. 
Some clues first came from the island of Cyprus in 1983, 
when archaeologists found a cat's jawbone dating back 8,000 years.
Since it seemed highly unlikely that humans would have brought wild cats over to the island , 
the finding suggested that domestication occurred before 8,000 years ago.</p>
<p>In 2004, the unearthing of an even older site at Cyprus,
in which a cat had been deliberately buried with a human,
made it even more certain that the island's ancient cats were domesticated, 
and pushed the domestication date back at least another 1,500 years.</p>
<p>In 2007, a study published in the research journal Science secured more pieces in the cat-domestication puzzle based on genetic analyses. 
All domestic cats, the authors declared, descended from a Middle Eastern wildcat,
 Felis sylvestris, which literally means "cat of the woods".
Cats were first domesticated in the Near East, 
and some of the study authors speculate that the process began up to 12,000 years ago.</p></h3>
<h2>Mysterious Cats</h2>
<h3><p>Cats are common domestic animals that have lived next to a man for over ten thousand years. But surprisingly, no one can proudly say that he has fully trained a cat and can manage it every minute.</p>
<p>  The next paradox, that made cats famous, is that they have never been mentioned in the Bible!
    But at the same time they are allowed a free access to the temples because they help to get rid of rats and mice. How could this happen? Scientists have studied this incredible plexus of the diametrically opposite events for a long time and put forward several hypotheses.
    The first assumption: the Bible is historically not such an accurate description of the way of life and customs of the inhabitants of ancient Palestine. The purpose of the text was to introduce to the people the opportunity to create their own salvation through the adoption of the Divine. Pets were mentioned in the Scripture only in a metaphorical meaning or a special context to create vivid descriptive images. Cats and their habits were not good for this purpose.The second hypothesis: the cult of the sacred cats in ancient Egypt, where Jews, freed from slavery, created the texts of the Bible. The ancient Egyptians deified these pets, made idols of them. Those who were guilty were punished severely for doing any harm to these animals or killing them. While creating Jewish texts, the future components of the Bible, they tried to fight the idols in any manifestation. The Jews considered that the cat was an idol, to worship it reverently was impossible. That was a great sin. Any mention of a cat was viewed as idolatry. For this reason, the usual domestic animals were not noted in any of the canonical texts of the Scriptures.

<h2>Cats' anatomy </h2>
<p>Cats have seven cervical vertebrae like almost all mammals, thirteen thoracic vertebrae (humans have twelve), seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five), 
three sacral vertebrae (humans have five because of their bipedal posture), and, except for Manx cats and other shorter tailed cats, 
twenty-two or twenty-three caudal vertebrae (humans have three to five, fused into an internal coccyx). 
The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's enhanced spinal mobility and flexibility, compared to humans. 
The caudal vertebrae form the tail, used by the cat as a counterbalance to the body during quick movements. 
Between their vertebrae, they have elastic discs, useful for cushioning the jump landings.
Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones,
which allows them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their heads.</p>
